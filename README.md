# Description

I am a 17-year-old Lebanese student attending school and developing iOS apps concurrently since 2017.

Besides programming, I find joy in hobbies such as football (soccer), road bike racing, electronics, music composition, drawing and writing. I also love languages, and I am fluent in English, French and Arabic, intermediate in Spanish, and beginner in German.

# Computer Languages

Before starting iOS development and diving headfirst into the fascinating world of the type-safe and protocol-oriented Swift language, I was programming since 2013. The following are some of all the programming, markup and style-sheet languages I have ever used.
