# Description

I am a student from Lebanon, attending university and developing iOS apps concurrently since 2017. Since then, I've branched out to writing articles, building this website, and more! 

Besides programming, I fancy hobbies such as playing football (soccer), composing music, drawing and reading. I also love languages, and I am fluent in English, French, and Arabic, intermediate in Spanish, and beginner in German.

# Computer Languages

Before starting iOS development and diving headfirst into the fascinating world of the type-safe and protocol-oriented Swift language, I had been dabbling with other languages since 2013. Here are some programming, markup, and style-sheet languages I use.
