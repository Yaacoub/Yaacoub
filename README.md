# Description

I am a computer engineering student at INSA de Lyon, developing iOS apps and other projects on the side since middle school. Along the way, I've expanded my horizons to writing articles, building this website, and diving into various creative pursuits!

Besides programming, I fancy hobbies such as playing football (soccer), composing music and drawing. I also love languages, and I am native in English, French, and Arabic, intermediate in Spanish, and beginner in German, and Russian.
