# Hi there 👋

🏆 <b><ins>WWDC2020 Swift Student Challenge Winner</ins><b>

Hi, I'm Peter Yaacoub, a 16 years old Lebanese student who has been attending school and developing iOS apps concurrently 🔀 since 2017. Besides programming, I find joy in hobbies such as football (soccer), electronics, music composition, drawing and writing! 👨🏻‍🎨 I also love languages. I'm fluent in English, French and Arabic, advanced in Spanish, and intermediate in German.

## 🗺 "Journey"

In truth, I have been programming since 2013, first starting with <b>HTML</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/e44d26/000000?text=+) and <b>CSS</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/264de4/000000?text=+) . After building several websites for fun, I branched out my knowledge and began building applications with <b>C++</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/004482/000000?text=+) , <b>C#</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/32007f/000000?text=+) and <b>Python</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/366d9a/000000?text=+) . It isn't until 2017 that I dove, head first, into the fascinating world of the type-safe and protocol-oriented <b>Swift</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/fd2722/000000?text=+) language. I haven't looked back ever since.

## 🎒 "Inventory"

Throughout the years, I have gained incredible experience with a majority of software for prototyping, image manipulation and video editing. Tools I have worked with include the likes of the <b>Creative Cloud</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/da1f26/000000?text=+) bundle, <b>Visual Studio</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/55208a/000000?text=+) and <b>Xcode</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/0a81fe/000000?text=+) . I have also used numerous online tools to complement my workflow and to better myself, which include the likes of <b>Admob</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/ea4335/000000?text=+) , <b>GitHub</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/000000?text=+) and <b>Firebase</b> ![](https://placehold.it/15/039be5/000000?text=+) .
